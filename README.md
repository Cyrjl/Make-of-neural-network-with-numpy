# Make-of-neural-network-with-numpy

Hello, welcome to our project !

The objective was to build our own neural network and test it in a simple classification problem coming from Belle II physics.

On this repository, you will find : 

* the necessary packages to run the codes in requirements.txt

* the neural network we built in NetworkModule.py

* the Jupyter notebook containing the different tests in Final_NeuralNet.ipynb

* the dataset used for the classification problem in dataset.csv

## How to run the notebook

You can install the packages contained in requirements.txt in a dedicated Python environment, then connect on a Jupyter notebook and run the notebook Final_NeuralNet.ipynb. It takes about 10 min to run.

We are using a random seed for the initialization of the parameters, thus the results could be different than those presented in the article.
